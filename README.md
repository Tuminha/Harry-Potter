- **Recall (Popular)**: 68% (Catches 68% of all popular stories)
- **F1-Score**: 0.71 (Good balance for popular class)
- **Test Sample**: 24,659 observations
- **No Data Leakage**: Clean, realistic performance

### 📌 Business Interpretation
- **Most Important Features:** Story length (log_words), Harry presence, Hermione presence
- **Key Insights:** 
  - Harry stories are 362% more likely to be popular
  - Hermione stories are 305% more likely to be popular
  - Ron stories are 50% less likely to be popular
  - Multi-chapter stories are 67% less likely to be popular
- **Critical Discovery:** Data leakage detection prevented unrealistic model performance

### 🎓 Key Lesson Learned: StatsModels vs scikit-learn Feature Engineering
- **StatsModels**: Automatically includes interaction terms in formula-based models
- **scikit-learn**: Requires manual feature engineering for interaction terms
- **Impact**: Missing `harry:hermione` interaction (-1.37 coefficient) in scikit-learn model
- **Business Insight**: Character combinations matter - Harry+Hermione stories are less popular than expected
- **Best Practice**: Always ensure feature parity between statistical and ML models
